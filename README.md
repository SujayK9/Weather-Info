In this website, we can get the live weather information of any city in the world. we just need to input city name and we get the current temperature, general weather, minimum and maximum temperature on that day.

This weather app is built using React.js library.
Uses Weather APIs to fetch the weather data based on city.
Works on react functional component with the help of different Hooks.
Using debouncing, we optimize the code by limiting the fetch calls.
